'''
game.py â€” Space Exploration Game Module

The game module runs the space exploration game.

It coordinates gameplay by integrating the map functionality from space_map.py
and the Ship class from ship.py. This module initialises the space exploration
map and ship, and runs the game where players issue commands to explore the 
map, interact with entities, and aim to reach the destination.
