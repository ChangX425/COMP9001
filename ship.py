'''
ship.py â€” Ship Module

This module defines the Ship class used in the space exploration game.

The Ship class encapsulates all functionality related to the player's ship,
including the ship's current state (position, fuel, health, and minerals)
and methods to manage movement, resource consumption, interactions with map
entities and displaying status reports.

        Handles the ship's interaction with a map entity based on its symbol

        The interaction varies depending on the type of entity. Each 
        interaction may affect the ship's state (e.g., coordinates, health, 
        minerals, etc).

        Parameters:
            symbol (str): The symbol representing the entity 
                    (' ', 'X', '.', 'E', 'M', 'R')
            symbol_x (int): The x-coordinate of the entity
            symbol_y (int): The y-coordinate of the entity
  
        Returns:
            bool: True if the ship moves to the entity's coordinates, 
                  False otherwise.
